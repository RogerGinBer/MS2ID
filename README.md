## Introduction

This package annotates MS2 query spectra by using an in-house database.
The creation of such database from (mostly publicly) available resources
(HMDB, ChEBI, PubChemâ€¦) relies on the use of the
[Compound](https://github.com/EuracBiomedicalResearch/CompoundDb)
package developed by J. Stanstrup and J. Rainer.
